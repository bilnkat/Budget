Sure, here's a breakdown of each data structure along with basic operations:

1. **Lists**:
   - **Creation**: Lists are created using square brackets `[]` and can contain elements of any data type.
     ```python
     my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     ```
   - **Access**: Elements of a list can be accessed using their index.
     ```python
     print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
     ```
   - **Modification**: Elements of a list can be modified using their index.
     ```python
     my_list[0] = 10
     print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     ```

2. **Tuples**:
   - **Creation**: Tuples are created using parentheses `()` and can contain elements of any data type.
     ```python
     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     ```
   - **Access**: Elements of a tuple can be accessed using their index.
     ```python
     print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
     ```
   - **Modification**: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation.

3. **Sets**:
   - **Creation**: Sets are created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function and can contain elements of any data type. Sets contain only unique elements.
     ```python
     my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
     ```
   - **Access**: Sets are unordered, so you cannot access elements by index.
   - **Modification**: Elements of a set can be added or removed.
     ```python
     my_set.add(6)
     my_set.remove(3)
     print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
     ```

4. **Dictionaries**:
   - **Creation**: Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{}` and consist of key-value pairs.
     ```python
     my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
     ```
   - **Access**: Elements of a dictionary can be accessed using their keys.
     ```python
     print(my_dict['a'])  # Output: 1
     ```
   - **Modification**: Elements of a dictionary can be modified using their keys.
     ```python
     my_dict['a'] = 10
     print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 10, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
     ```

These are the basic operations with each of the mentioned data structures in Python. Each has its own use cases and advantages depending on the specific requirements of a program.
